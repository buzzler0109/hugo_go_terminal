    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>Since the beginning of the russian-ukrainian armed conflict, the international community has repeatedly documented war crimes. However, many human rights violations in occupied territories and combat zones often go unnoticed and never reach the judicial authorities due to a lack of evidence.</p>

        <div class="goal-accent">We believe - </div>
        <div class="goal-accent-2">The stories of war crimes victims must be heard and thoroughly investigated.</div>

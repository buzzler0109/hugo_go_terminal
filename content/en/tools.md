## Our instruments, some access might be restricted for SHUM personnel only.

1. [Aggregator](https://aggregator.shum-ng.org/) - A web-based tool that extracts data from sources on request and enables comparative analysis between them. This solves the issue of budgeting for such requests and provides operators with the ability to cross-verify data from different sources.

   * Access is limited: exclusively for the SHUM team and partners.
   * We are considering additional opportunities for cooperation with data providers.
2. [CVAT](https://cvat.shum-ng.org/prelogin/) - A web-based tool for dataset annotation, a project-specific platform designed for high-quality image and video annotation. Built on the powerful open-source CVAT framework, it supports a range of annotation types including bounding boxes, segmentation masks, polygons, and keypoints. The tool features role-based access control, ensuring only authorized personnel can view or modify project data. Tasks are organized by project, with built-in progress tracking, version control, and annotation auditing to maintain data integrity and oversight. Custom labeling schemas and automation via API integration make it ideal for complex, domain-specific applications, including intelligence and defense workflows.Â 

   * Access is restricted to the project-related personnel and partners only.
   * Please check our blog for further updates.

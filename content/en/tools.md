## Our instruments, some access might be restricted for SHUM personnel only.

1. [Aggregator](https://aggregator.shum-ng.org/) - A web-based tool that extracts data from sources on request and enables comparative analysis between them. This solves the issue of budgeting for such requests and provides operators with the ability to cross-verify data from different sources.

   * Access is limited: exclusively for the SHUM team and partners.
   * We are considering additional opportunities for cooperation with data providers.

# About Us

SHUM is a public organization created by experts from the international OSINT community. We use OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) technologies to investigate crimes in the armed conflict initiated by russia against Ukraine, as well as to provide consultations to law enforcement and judicial authorities, combat disinformation, and participate in projects aimed at protecting human rights.

## Mission

Since the beginning of the russian-ukrainian armed conflict, the international community has repeatedly witnessed war crimes committed by the russian federation. At the same time, human rights violations in combat zones and occupied territories of Ukraine often go unnoticed. Due to a lack of evidence, such cases often fail to reach judicial authorities.

We believe that the stories of victims of war crimes must be heard and thoroughly investigated. Our duty is to highlight this information, gather evidence, and identify potential criminals.

Our organization is ready to work together with law enforcement and judicial authorities and provide them with consultations. (Perhaps we should mention lawyers or legal specialists who are part of the team here).

In its activities, SHUM is guided by two principles: transparency and efficiency. Therefore, we have implemented monthly financial reporting, which is subject to external audit by the supervisory board of the international public organization OSINT For Ukraine and key sponsors.

The team is also open to cooperation with other national and international public organizations.

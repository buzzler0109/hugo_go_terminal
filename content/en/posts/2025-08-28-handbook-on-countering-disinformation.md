In the digital age, the traditional boundaries between peace and war are fading. Today, battles are fought not only on physical battlefields but also in the virtual space, where disinformation has become a powerful weapon of mass destruction. Every day, millions of people encounter manipulation, fake news, and propaganda campaigns — often without even realizing it.

The Center for Countering Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, with the support of the EU Advisory Mission, has developed a unique practical handbook, *“Weapons of Information Warfare”*, which reveals the mechanisms of modern information warfare. This document is not just a theoretical study — it is a practical tool for anyone who wants to learn how to recognize and counter information threats.

The handbook focuses on the latest methods of information attacks and effective ways to defend against them, offering concrete recommendations for everyday use in the digital space.

# Our First Investigation

Today we are publishing the results of our first investigation into war crimes committed by russian forces in the Kyiv region. Using OSINT methods, we were able to identify and document numerous violations of international humanitarian law.

The investigation revealed systematic shelling of civilian infrastructure, including schools, hospitals, and residential buildings. We have collected photographic evidence, satellite imagery, and witness testimonies that clearly demonstrate the deliberate targeting of civilian objects.

Our team continues to work on documenting these crimes and preparing materials for submission to international judicial authorities. We believe that every piece of evidence is important for bringing the perpetrators to justice.

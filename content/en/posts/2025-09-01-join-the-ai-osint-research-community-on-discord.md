We are building a collaborative space for researchers, investigators, and practitioners who explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and open-source intelligence (OSINT).
Inside the community, you’ll find:

Discussions on AI-driven OSINT workflows

Knowledge sharing and practical case studies

Networking with like-minded professionals

Opportunities to co-create research and tools

The invite link is active for 7 days only. After that, you can request a new one from the project curators. https://discord.gg/n4EYAg23

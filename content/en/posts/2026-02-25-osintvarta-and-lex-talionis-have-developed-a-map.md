6,000 defense-industrial complex enterprises of the russian federation are now available on an interactive map.



Lex Talionis and OsintVarta have developed a map of enterprises operating within the aggressor state. The platform includes descriptions of their activities and specific developments, information on vetted employees with enriched data, as well as structured categorization for easier navigation and analysis. All datasets are available for download.



This is a strong example of OSINT work that transforms fragmented information into an analytical resource and makes a meaningful contribution to data transparency.

We are raising funds to purchase a vehicle for our friend, a service member who has been defending Ukraine since the first days of the full-scale invasion.
Currently, while carrying out missions in the Kharkiv sector, he and his team require a vehicle for logistics and other essential needs that regularly arise in the combat zone.

* Fundraising goal: A donation for a car for the AKS in the Kharkiv direction for logistical and other related tasks that constantly appear on the front line.
* Donation link: https://send.monobank.ua/jar/2fMyRuT3K2
* IBAN UA 54 322001 0000 0262 0335 85641 64

Every contribution brings us closer to achieving the goal and increases the unitâ€™s operational efficiency.

We’ve refreshed our Donation Hub to make supporting SHUM OSINT simpler and faster. The page is now a single place where you can choose the method that fits you best and complete a donation in a couple of clicks.

What’s new:

* Monobank jar / card payment — quick top-ups with an option to pay by card.
* Crypto donations — via Plisio, helping us fund the tools and infrastructure that keep our work running.
* A clearer “Join the team” call-to-action if you want to contribute with skills, not only money.

If SHUM’s work matters to you — drop by the Donation Hub, pick your preferred method, and support our operations. Every contribution helps us stay effective and resilient.

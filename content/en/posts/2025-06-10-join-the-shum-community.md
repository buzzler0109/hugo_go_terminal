#### **How to get involved:**

2. **Questionnaire** — helps us understand your skills, interests, and experience
3. **Interview and screening** — a conversation to determine how you can contribute
4. **Reference check** — we verify applicants through recommendations
5. **Training or test assignment** — depending on the area of engagement

We value competence, responsibility, and motivation. If you’re ready to work with us in a structured and professional way — submit your application, and we will get in touch.

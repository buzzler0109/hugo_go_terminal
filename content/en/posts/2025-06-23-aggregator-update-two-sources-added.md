The Aggregator tool has been updated with two new data sources. OpenSanctionsDB is a database that consolidates information on sanctions lists, politically exposed persons (PEPs), and entities involved in corruption schemes, financial crimes, and sanctions evasion. Integrating OpenSanctions provides the system with more comprehensive and structured datasets compiled from official sources worldwide. In turn, this enables more effective detection of links between individuals and organizations during investigations. The second integrated source remains undisclosed.

We continue to expand the toolâ€™s functionality!

The SHUM team is working on building infrastructure to support OSINT research, and one of the internal solutions is a leak aggregator. This is a web-based tool that allows users to query data from leak databases and perform comparative analysis across different sources.

The practical value of this tool lies in providing analysts with a reliable way to verify information from various leaks while staying within operational budget constraints. It helps centralize access to data and enables fast cross-checking without the need for multiple individual subscriptions or time-consuming manual comparisons.

Access to the aggregator is currently limited — it is used exclusively by the SHUM team and partners. We are considering gradually expanding the tool’s capabilities, including through API integrations with data providers. If you’re interested in collaboration or integration — we invite you to contact us!

The Aggregator tool has been updated with **one new data source: LeakCheck**. LeakCheck is a breach-search service that helps identify exposed credentials and related leak artifacts by searching across large leak datasets (e.g., email/username and other supported query types), with options for API-based integration, monitoring, and bulk checks.

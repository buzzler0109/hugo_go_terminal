In today’s world, disinformation has become one of the most dangerous tools for undermining democratic values and social stability. Fake news, manipulative content, and coordinated influence campaigns threaten the foundations of an informed society, erode trust in institutions, and create polarization in public opinion.

The Center for Countering Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, with the support of the European Union Advisory Mission in Ukraine, has presented a fundamental handbook on countering disinformation. This document summarizes the best international practices in combating information threats and adapts them to the Ukrainian context.

The handbook is designed as a practical tool for civil servants, journalists, educators, and everyone working in the field of information security. It provides a detailed analysis of modern disinformation methods, fact-checking algorithms, recommendations on media literacy, and strategies for countering organized information campaigns.

In the event of a person going missing under special circumstances, it is important to act promptly and in accordance with officially approved procedures.
We are sharing two official resources that may assist families in such situations. The step-by-step guidance, prepared by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, outlines the necessary actions, filing procedures, and contact information for relevant state authorities.
We also recommend reviewing the memo developed by the Office of the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, which provides general information for families of prisoners of war, missing persons, and unlawfully detained civilians.

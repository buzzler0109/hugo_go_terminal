# A team of experts from the international OSINT community launches the SHUM project.

SHUM is a public organization whose goal is to apply OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) technologies to investigate crimes in the armed conflict initiated by russia against Ukraine, as well as to provide consultations to law enforcement and judicial authorities, combat disinformation, and participate in projects aimed at protecting human rights.

The SHUM team is guided by two principles: transparency and efficiency. Therefore, we have implemented monthly financial reporting, which is subject to external audit by the supervisory board of the international public organization OSINT For Ukraine and key sponsors. Thanks to the open funding model, our organization has the opportunity to impartially investigate probable international crimes committed during the armed conflict.

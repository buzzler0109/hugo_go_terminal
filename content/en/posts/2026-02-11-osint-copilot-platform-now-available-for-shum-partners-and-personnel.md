OSINT Copilot is an intelligence automated solution to quickly collect and organize open-source information in one place. Instantly structured data instead of spending time manually assembling information.

The Service utilizes AI and LLMs to generate reports, summaries, and risk assessments.

OSINT Copilot can help you:

• Collect information from multiple open sources

• Organize and structure data into clear, connected entities

• Analyze relationships, patterns, and signals across datasets

• Reduce manual work and constant switching between tools

OSINT Copilot software is also available as a plugin for Obsidian, providing powerful graph-based views to visually explore relationships, connections, and networks across investigations.

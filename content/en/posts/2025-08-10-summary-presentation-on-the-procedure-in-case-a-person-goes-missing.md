To make it easier to navigate the available official information on the procedures in case a person goes missing under special circumstances, we have prepared a brief presentation based on materials from the Coordination Headquarters, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Office of the Ombudsman.
It summarizes essential information on how to act in cases of captivity or disappearance, how to seek assistance, which institutions to contact, and what to keep in mind in the initial stages.

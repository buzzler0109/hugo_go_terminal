# Partnership with International Organizations

We are pleased to announce the establishment of partnerships with several international organizations working in the field of human rights protection and war crimes investigation.

These partnerships will allow us to:
- Share expertise and best practices in OSINT investigations
- Coordinate efforts in documenting war crimes
- Provide mutual support in legal proceedings
- Develop joint projects aimed at protecting human rights

We believe that such international cooperation is crucial for effectively investigating war crimes and bringing perpetrators to justice. Together, we can make a greater impact in protecting human rights and ensuring justice for victims of war crimes.

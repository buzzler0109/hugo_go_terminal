The public organization SHUM CAMP brings together specialists from the international community who work with open-source information and document crimes committed during the armed conflict unleashed by russia against Ukraine. We develop our own tools for data collection and analysis, support law enforcement authorities, and counter disinformation.

### **What You Will Be Doing**

* Develop and maintain web applications for the OSINT community (TypeScript + React);
* Build a reliable backend and microservices for data processing (Python; optionally Node.js/Golang);
* Design and configure databases (PostgreSQL as the primary database; MongoDB/Typesense/ClickHouse optional);
* Integrate LLMs (Large Language Models) and build RAG architectures for analyzing large text corpora;
* Create and orchestrate automated workflows (n8n, AI Agents);
* Work with containerization (Docker, Docker Compose) and understand network architecture;
* Develop cross-platform mobile applications in Flutter (Dart) for iOS and Android from a single codebase, managing app state with a focus on an offline-first architecture;
* Contribute to designing the architecture of systems for data collection and analysis.

### **Who We Are Looking For**

We are looking for an independent specialist who is ready to take ownership of technical decisions.

#### Technical Requirements (Hard Skills)

* Core stack: Python, TypeScript + React, PostgreSQL, Docker / Docker Compose;
* AI & Automation (a major plus): experience with LLM integration, RAG, prompt engineering, building AI agents, and automation via n8n;
* Optional (welcome): Node.js, Golang, MongoDB, Typesense, ClickHouse;
* Experience developing cross-platform mobile applications in Flutter (Dart);
* Foundation: understanding of network architecture.

#### Key Principles & Soft Skills

* Discipline — tasks often have strict time constraints;
* High autonomy and responsibility in defining scope and product requirements;
* Adaptability to changes in projects;
* Ownership and accountability for results — it’s important that you don’t just write code, but solve engineering problems;
* Ukrainian language proficiency; English (Intermediate+) is a plus for working with documentation and APIs.

### **What We Offer**

* Remote volunteer participation (work from anywhere);
* A flexible schedule and part-time involvement;
* Work on real technical challenges in the fields of OSINT and AI;
* An opportunity to apply modern approaches (RAG, AI Agents) in socially meaningful projects;
* Participation in a closed community of technical specialists and analysts;
* Projects that provide a high level of trust, freedom, and autonomy for each participant;
* The opportunity to work on real-world tasks and build a portfolio with practical solutions, not just pet projects.

We work with volunteers from all over Ukraine and worldwide.

Join us and become part of a team that makes real change!
